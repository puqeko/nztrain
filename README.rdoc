=== Installation
Currently on Ubuntu 16.04.

Install ruby 2.3 with {RVM}[https://github.com/rvm/ubuntu_rvm].

Run `script/install.bash` to install dependencies. Leave everything default for development.

`script/update.bash` will pull changes from origin and recompile various things. This includes assets - assuming that it is for production purposes.

Both scripts depends on `script/install.cfg`, which is built using `script/install/config.bash` automatically. If `script/install.cfg` is incomplete (eg. new configuration is added), `script/install.bash` and `script/update.bash` will prompt for the new configurations required.

Run tests: `bundle exec rake db:test:load` then `bundle exec spec`
Run server: `bundle exec rails server`
Run judge: `bundle exec rake qless:work`

=== Development Tools
- `spring` instead of `bundle exec` to keep a background copy of rails running, and avoid startup time.
- `unicorn` starts off a development server (instead of Webrick).
